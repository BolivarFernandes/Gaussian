# Gaussian

This library was developed targeting `Arduino` applications. However, works just great with any C++.

The use of Gaussians is really hard because requires a deep understanding about complex math. **Not anymore.**  
We have done it for you, fell free to use the fully-implemented class of `Gaussian`.  
Do you want to do a [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average)? `GaussianAverage` is just what you are looking for.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/ivanseidel/Gaussian/releases) the Latest release from gitHub.
2. Unzip and modify the Folder name to "Gaussian" (Remove the '-version')
3. Paste the modified folder on your Library folder (On your `Libraries` folder inside Sketchbooks or Arduino software).

## Getting started

### `Gaussian` class

A class that contains a `mean` and a `variance` attribute.

Also contains methods to do sums with others `Gaussians`.

#### To declare a simple Gaussian:
```c++
// Simple Gaussian initialization and instantiation
Gaussian myGaussian = Gaussian(mean, variance);

// This will declare a Gaussian with mean = 0 and variance = MAX_VARIANCE (A really big value)
Gaussian myGaussian = Gaussian();

// This will do the same as above
Gaussian myGaussian();
```

To call a function `handler` `10` times a second:

```c++
Timer3.attachInterrupt(handler).setFrequency(10).start();
```

In case you need to stop a timer, just do like this:

```c++
Timer3.stop();
```

And to continue running:

```c++
Timer3.start();
```

There are `9` Timer objects already instantiated for you:
`Timer0`, `Timer1`, `Timer2`, `Timer3`, `Timer4`, `Timer5`, `Timer6`, `Timer7` and `Timer8`.

### TIPs and Warnings

```c++
Timer4.attatchInterrupt(handler).setFrequency(10).start();
// Is the same as:
Timer4.attatchInterrupt(handler);
Timer4.setFrequency(10);
Timer4.start();

// To create a custom timer, refer to:
DueTimer myTimer = DueTimer(0); // Creates a Timer 0 object.
DueTimer myTimer = DueTimer(3); // Creates a Timer 3 object.
DueTimer myTimer = DueTimer(t); // Creates a Timer t object.
// Note: Maximum t allowed is 8, as there is only 9 timers [0..8];

Timer1.setHandler(handler1).start(10);
Timer1.setHandler(handler2).start(10);
DueTimer myTimer = DueTimer(1);
myTimer.setHandler(handler3).start(20);
// Will run only handle3, on Timer 1 (You are just overriding the callback)

Timer.getAvailable().attachInterrupt(callback1).start(10);
// Start timer on first available timer
DueTimer::getAvailable().attachInterrupt(callback2).start(10);
// Start timer on second available timer
// And so on...
```

## Library Reference

### You should know:

- `getAvailable()` - Get the first available Timer.

- `attachInterrupt(void (*isr)())` - Attach a interrupt (callback function) for the timer of the object.

- `detachInterrupt()` - Detach current callback of timer.

- `start(long microseconds = -1)` - Start the timer with an optional period parameter.

- `stop()` - Stop the timer

- `setFrequency(long frequency)` - Set the timer frequency

- `long getFrequency()` - Get the timer frequency

- `setPeriod(long microseconds)` - Set the timer period (in microseconds)

- `long getPeriod()` - Get the timer period (in microseconds)

### You don't need to know:

- `int timer` - Stores the object timer id (to acces Timers struct array).

- `DueTimer(int _timer)` - Instantiate a new DueTimer object for Timer _timer (NOTE: All objects are already instantiated!).

- `static const Timer Timers[]` - Stores all timers information

- `static void (*callbacks[])()` - Stores all callbacks for all timers
